Scripting languages often have functions, such as eval(), that allow interpreting a string or a file as a part of the application. The danger of using these functions is that, under certain conditions, an attacker may be able to supply malicious code and it will be executed as a part of the application. This gives the attacker full control of the application. Code injection vulnerabilities affect all scripting languages, but typically occur in web applications written in PHP.  

=Impact

An attacker gains full control of the application and the ability to use any operating system functions that are available to the scripting environment. Code injection is one of the most dangerous vulnerability types, if not the most dangerous. On top of being extremely powerful, code injection vulnerabilities are typically easy to exploit, especially in web applications. 

=Countermeasures

To prevent code injection vulnerabilities, validate all input and avoid using dangerous functions. 

=Application Check

To check for adequate protection against this vulnerability, find all the calls to dangerous functions and verify that data passed to them is sufficiently validated.
