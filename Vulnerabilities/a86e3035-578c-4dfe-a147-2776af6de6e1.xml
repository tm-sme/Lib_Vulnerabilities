Applications use connection strings to specify credentials used to access databases. If the application includes unvalidated user input in connection strings, an attacker may be able to change what databases the application connects to. Connection string injection vulnerabilities apply to applications that connect to databases. 

=Impact

By manipulating the connection string, an attacker is able to cause the application to connect to an unintended data source. The attacker may be able to bypass authentication by re-routing the application to use his own database. The attacker may also get data from another database by re-routing the application to use it. The exact impact of a connection string injection vulnerability is difficult to predict because it is heavily dependent on application logic. Overall, the connection string vulnerability is difficult for an attacker to use, but it is still a serious vulnerability.

=Countermeasures

To prevent connection string injection vulnerabilities, validate all input, store connection strings securely, and don't use user input in connection strings. 

Validate all input:
* [[3de41277-0cc1-4ebc-8dd7-e96d161aa0ef|Validate All Input]]
* [[e59923e7-c2fb-4a75-8db7-a9a91e869f74|Validate Input for Length, Range, Format, And Type]]

Store connection strings securely:
* [[612e1d5c-8b41-43ef-a203-daa6f814c57b|Encrypt SQL Connection Strings with DPAPI]]
* [[b42bbac5-7441-436a-92a5-a0d05593c62c|Encrypt SQL Connection Strings with RSA on Web Farms]]

Don't use user input in connection strings:
* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000061594a|Do Not Use User Input in Connection Strings]]

=Application Check

To check for adequate protection against connection string injection vulnerabilities, find all connection strings used by the application and verify that all input is validated, connection strings are stored securely, and user input is not used in connection strings. 

All input is validated:
* [[a210fcb7-f142-4c2e-844a-c43e0859f90d|All Input Is Validated]]
* [[0e71dd64-87d1-4cf5-9569-ea320f209977|Input Is Validated for Length, Range, Format, And Type]]

Connection strings are stored securely:
* [[eb8d54d3-1d59-4d33-ba54-b69df5d2eb74|Connection Strings Are Encrypted]]

User input is not used in connection strings:
* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000040c40b|User Input Is Not Used in Connection Strings]]
