    <Data><![CDATA[=Description

A parameter tampering vulnerability occurs when an attacker can modify parameters used by a web application that have security implications. For example, a vulnerable application may allow an attacker to change his user id by changing request parameters. The vulnerability stems from relying on user-accessible parameters to store security sensitive information. Common vulnerable areas are data stored in cookies, hidden form fields, and HTTP request parameters. This vulnerability type applies to web applications. 

=Impact

The exact impact of parameter tampering depends on the parameters that are available for tampering. This vulnerability usually allows the attacker to change his status from regular user to admin. In that case, the attacker is able to take full control of the application and its data. Another common impact is that the attacker is able to change his user id to that of another user. In that case the attacker can access and modify the user's data and impersonate that user. Parameter tampering usually allows the attacker to impersonate any user of his choosing. 

=Countermeasures

To prevent this problem, use platform provided session management, don't store sensitive data in user accessible parameters, and use strong session identifiers. 

Use platform-provided session management:
* [[b42309de-b99e-4a32-a36e-6c4cdf9e3a6e|Use PHP Session Management]]

Don't store sensitive data in user accessible parameters:
* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000004f4246|Do Not Store Sensitive Data in User Accessible Parameters]]

Use strong session identifiers:
* [[e00c3d06-d939-494d-a42c-88878f26f2fc|Use Strong Session IDs]]

=Application Check

To check for adequate protection against this vulnerability, ensure that platform provided session management is used, sensitive data is not stored in user accessible parameters, and strong session identifiers are used. Identify all user-mutable parameters and verify that tampering with them does not result in elevated privileges.

Platform-provided session management is used:
* [[bc3f332a-c395-486b-b095-6b7cc4935367|PHP Session Management Is Used]]

Sensitive data is not stored in user accessible parameters:
* [[00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000080bc3b|Sensitive Data Is Not Stored in User Accessible Parameters]]

Strong session identifiers are used:
