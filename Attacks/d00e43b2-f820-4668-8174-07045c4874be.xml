Any application that uses credentials.

=Description

A dictionary attack is a technique to defeat weak authentication credentials using a pre-compiled list of common usernames and passwords. It relies on the fact that users tend to use weak passwords that can be easily remembered. Though similar to a brute-force attack, this technique is faster as it exhausts only the common possibilities. The input-set in a dictionary attack is limited to words that could be derived from a dictionary, hence the name of the attack.

If the attacker has a lot of time available and the application does not deny repeated login attempts after a threshold number of attempts, the attacker may script login attempts using large lists of usernames and passwords. Username lists and common password lists are freely available from many websites.

=Impact

    *Credential compromise.

=Vulnerabilities

    *Weak password policy.

=Countermeasures

    *Enforce strong passwords: Applications should enforce strong passwords that require users to construct their passwords using a larger input-set. 
    *An example of strong password requirements is:
        **At least 8 characters long.
        **Contains lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters.
        **The password is regularly changed by the user, such as once every 3 months.
